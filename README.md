# Janky Shimmer

`border-shimmer` allows users to create a subtle effect where the borders around
their windows (managed by the github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders software) can
contain an animated transition among a sequence of user-configurable colors.

**TODO(eljobe)**: Add a demo gif or video.

**TODO(eljobe)**: Add instructions on building and runnig, or possibly a brew
  formula like that used by JankyBorders.
